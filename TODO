- SFTP to send files between vyvn@192.168.1.220 and vyvn@192.168.1.230
- [Bug] For now files to gdrive might only come from jnash@192.168.1.220
- Audio metadata
- rclone, need to easliy connect on arch
- Lets ensure vyvn can run script then run record straight away
- Rec eca and a Session eca, i want to hear the same mix. Audio dir
  has new file layout. 
- appending images...
- Work test session and rec eca files into tests
- Mention nginx needs to be configured, to view files, sudo user needs to
  move them.
- Updates to scripts in bin need moving to /usr/local/bin
  for environment variable.
