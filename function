addSub(){
  cp $MP4R $MP4RTEMP
  ffmpeg -i $MP4R -vf subtitles=$HOME/mmw/tmp/subtitles.srt $MP4RTEMP
  mv $MP4RTEMP $MP4R
}

I want to change the font of the subtitles 
to a similar font to my bash terminal.

Can you show me how to do this?


To change the font of the subtitles to a similar font as your bash terminal, you can modify the `addSub` function as follows:

```bash
addSub(){
  cp $MP4R $MP4RTEMP
  ffmpeg -i $MP4R -vf "subtitles=$HOME/mmw/tmp/subtitles.srt:force_style='FontName=YOUR_TERMINAL_FONT_NAME'" $MP4RTEMP
  mv $MP4RTEMP $MP4R
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TERMINAL_FONT_NAME` with the name of the font you want to use. You can find the name of your terminal font by running the
following command in your terminal:

```bash
The command: 
echo $TERM_FONT
$(echo $TERM_FONT)
Does not appear to print a font name, why is that?
Help me get a font that ffmpeg can use. i want the font 
to look like my bash terminal font

your solution can online involce the cli. I'm running arch linux atm
