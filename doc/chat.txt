I'm a Software Engineer and a Musician. You are my assistant. Your name is Susan. 

We are contending with reality by finding solutions to emerging problems. 
Our objective is to reduce a problem down to a single actionable solution. 

I want to think of our communication as a tool to render a most 
comprehensive cerebral map in the readers mind.

We want a conceptual model of the reality using words, code and music.

We may need this map to be able to expand to a large scale. Or scale down to something 
very small.

Analogies

For example imagine if we need to find someone on a particular
level in a building. We need to describe our problems as if our words
were rendering the building as a 3d Hollagram that we can use to instantaniously
strip away walls that enable us to  pin point where 
the person is exactly because all the best routes to them can be 
calculated with all obstacles on that route having been determined.

Problems solved are spinning plates. Sometimes you have to return to them to make
sure they are still spinning meaning have the solution still a solution.

A problem could be any observable phenomena, and it can have a high degree of entropy,
which I currently understand as a state of chaos. A solution should 
beable to be reduced to a single actionable step in order
to reduce this entropy.

I will present problems following these practices:

- Describe setting of the problem for context.
- Present problem as task..
- Instruct a format for the solution.
- Describe the reason for the solution.

Here comes a problem now...

Hello ChatGPT, in the context of
Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)
The DAW allows users to arrange and write their music in a .ly file. 
The DAW compiles the .ly file, producing a .pdf for sheet music and a .midi. 
Each instrument written to the sheet music is allocated its own channel in the midi file. 
The midi file is then processed by a .csd file. The .csd file is where users can design the sound 
for each instrument they've arranged in the .ly score. To hear the music, users utilize a .mix file 
to instruct the software on how, where, and when the music should be played.

Things details to discuss that I need the app to control away from the users perspective.

'options' file:
PROJPATH="$HOME/projects_/$PROJ"
LILY="$PROJPATH/src/$PROJ.ly"
MIX="$PROJPATH/src/mix.csd"
CSD="$PROJPATH/src/$PROJ.csd"
WAV="$HOME/audio/$PROJ.wav"
MP4="$HOME/motion-picture/$PROJ.mp4"
MP4R="$HOME/motion-picture/$PROJ-tt.mp4"
TEMPWOA="$HOME/motion-picture/$PROJ-temp-wo-audio.mp4"
TEMP="$HOME/motion-picture/$PROJ-temp.mp4"
WAVMIX="$HOME/audio/501.wav"
IMAGEFORM="$HOME/images/ig-canvas.png"
WATERMARK="$HOME/images/X.png"
TITLE="$HOME/images/title.png"
BPM="84"
BEAT=$(bc <<< "scale=4; (60/$BPM)")
BAR=$(bc <<< "scale=4;$BEAT*4")
DUR=$(bc <<< "scale=4;$BAR*1")
LENGTH=$(bc <<< "scale=2;$BAR*24")

'project' script file:
PROJ="202210030854-3"
source $HOME/mmw/tmp/options

# create .ly file and .mid file.
# Move .mid  to /tmp file of the project. This file 
# should probably say in the app. 
# The pdf is moved to docs. Because we want the score 
# to exists beyond the app. 
mmw.sh createLyScoreAndMidiFile $LILY $PROJPATH $PROJ

createLyScoreAndMidiFile(){
  lilypond -dmidi-extension=mid $1;
  #lilypond-book --output=out --format=html $1.lytex

  mv $3.mid $2/tmp/
  mv $3.pdf $2/doc/ 
}

# move pdf from proj location to a separate repo from mmw which displays the app.
# The Xuuki-Node-Site is acting as a UI. Its probably sensible to bring the node 
# express server into the mmw repo. High percentage of entropy from my perspective
# just to warn you Susan. Becuase theres c++ csound and node. can it all compule together
# will it need to. You'd need to critique that idea please.
cp $HOME/projects_/$PROJ/doc/$PROJ.pdf $HOME/Xuuki-Node-Site/display/public/


#this function outputs a wav file using the csd.
mmw.sh renderScore $WAV $CSD

renderScore(){
  csound -o$1 $2
}

# the interface isnt particully sophiticated yet

#This next command renders the audio file of the song
daw -d $PROJ

The next line moves the audio file into the Xuuk-Node-Site repo to be displayed
But we sould probably bring the UI into the mmw repo.
cp $HOME/audio/501.wav $HOME/Xuuki-Node-Site/display/public/$PROJ.wav

There are flaws the user has to make sure they manually select midi channels.
I would like you to help me refine all the steps and the detail of the steps that are involved in this
workflow. 

Could you please 
provide this information in the format of a critical conversation with code examples if necessary? 
This request is for the purpose of developing the design and the app itself. Thank you!

Vision
As a Software Engineer and Musician, my vision is to create harmonious synergies 
between music and technology, crafting unique musical experiences enabled by software solutions. 
I aspire to touch the bleeding edge of what's possible in both fields.

Mission
My mission is to apply my skills and knowledge in software engineering to solve complex problems 
in the music industry, and vice versa. By leveraging the technical rigor of software development 
and the creativity inherent in music, I aim to produce work that is both technically sound and 
artistically impactful.

Objectives
To develop a software solution within the next year that addresses a pressing issue in the 
music industry, such as digital rights management or music distribution.
To compose and produce an album within the next two years that incorporates 
elements of software-generated music or uses technology in a novel way.
To stay abreast of advancements in both fields and continuously integrate new knowledge 
and techniques into my work.
Strategy
My strategy involves continuous learning and cross-pollination between my two areas of 
expertise. I will stay updated on trends and advancements in both fields, seek opportunities 
for innovative applications of technology in music (and vice versa), and network 
with professionals from both industries to foster collaborative opportunities.

Tactics
Allocate dedicated time each week to learn about new developments in both fields.
Regularly exercise ideas for the intersection of music and technology.
Attend industry events, seminars, and meetups to network and collaborate with other professionals.
