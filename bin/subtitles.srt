1
00:00:2,679 --> 00:00:5,000
Baby momma rolling so we hit it on fire

2
00:00:5,360 --> 00:00:6,250
I don't have grace

3
00:00:6,964 --> 00:00:8,200
'til I hear them sigh

4
00:00:8,393 --> 00:00:10,536
Hasty for a minute got an Uber outside

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,000
Pacing 'til we're in it and we got the skyline

6
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:16,250
Thread it with a finger so I see it redesigned 

7
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:17,200
So a seed 

8
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,000
'til it be

9
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:18,380
that

10
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:18,700
tree

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,800
that I climb

12
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,100
Had to catch a plane

13
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,600
Now its day and night

14
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,100
Wrinkle in my shirt

15
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,300
Poket hankercheif to her lip and we're fine

16
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:30,536
Fuck it underneath and she squeeze and the theigh

17
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,393
can I get a drink with gold leaf and some ice

18
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:36,900
Think I fell asleep and woke up on arrival

19
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:37,979
Button on the floor

20
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,807
Can we pick it up

20
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,200
Cascade if we want

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,600
So we fall in love

22
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,000
Washed up while we fol-

23
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,500
-low these rivers

24
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,600
And they look like blood

25
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:47,600
On the body of who/what?

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,100
So now we live in the flood
