Regard the following bash script that creates 
an ecasound sound command.
$(cat bin/rec.eca)
I need a new line to start AFTER every \'\\'.
How do i express for bash to create a string with new lines?

Don't show me '\' '\' '\'n becuase it prints '\'n
Also '\'n seems to create a new line but it maintains \n
