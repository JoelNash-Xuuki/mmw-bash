regard createProj()
$(cat bin/mmw)

When I run this using a bats test it freezes becuase the user is asked if they want to create the file
$PROJPATH. is there a way to test can say yes for me?

pehaps the method of echo "Y"

piping into
in the test $(cat test/test-project.bats)
that creates aproj?

The piping echo technieu doesn't seem to work
