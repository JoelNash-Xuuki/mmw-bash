Regard the function collectFileSections in the following code:
$(cat src/SheetBuilder.cpp)

I need to add:
   }
  >>
to the file. these symbols appear in printStaffInGroupCloseBracket()
Currently i'm print after every staff which isn't what i want. Can you see 
a way for the logic to 'know' if theres yet another staff to print before 
appending the group close bracket?
it also needs to know if theres yet another staff group to print.
which means the count variables ie noteCount, staffGroupCount, staffCount
being 0 won't target the end of print a staff group and staff when theres
more staff groups and staffs to print
