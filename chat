Regard the following functions:
$(cat function)

The function processes file scorePatch:
$(cat /home/joel/projects_/patches/scorePatch)


You can see 4 STAFFGROUP strings in the file above correct?

I think my readPatchFile() function should be able to count all four
STAFFGROUP strings but I think it only counts two. Can you see why?
