Regard the function collectFileSections in the following code:
$(cat src/SheetBuilder.cpp)

I need to add:
   }
  >>
to the file. these symbols appear in printStaffInGroupCloseBracket()
once all the notes are printed in each staff group.
Currently I'm only managing to print the close bracket after all notes are printed/appended
and so the close bracket don't get added to a staff group if there is still a number
of notes to count through. can you help me think of a way to add the close bracket after
all notes are printed/appended within a given staff group?
This means before an additional staffgroup is added 
I need the close bracket symbols to be added.
