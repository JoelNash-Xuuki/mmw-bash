Regard the 
line fprintf(sheet,\"        \\include \\"/home/joel/projects_/notes/ns-%s\\"\n\",this->notes[count].pat)
in the function printAllNotesOnStaff()  
that is the following code of SheetBuilder.cpp:
$(cat src/SheetBuilder.cpp)

When i execute the printAllNotesOnStaff() i get a segmentation fault. im sure it has something to 
do with using this->notes[count].pat. 
Can you see how I can avoid this segmentation fault?
