Regard the 
in the function printAllNotesOnStaff()  
that is the following code of SheetBuilder.cpp:
$(cat src/SheetBuilder.cpp)

The last change I made was that I moved the line FILE* sheet= fopen(sheetStaffNotes, "w");
inside the for loop. This has caused a segmentation fault 
can you explain why I get this error 

I'm aiming to eventually created multiple files like in the function printStaffGroupHeader().
Can you ensure that your suggestion aims to ensure I can make multiple note files...
