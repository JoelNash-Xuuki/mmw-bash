This is my attempt to build a yaml file.
This file will be used by github actions
I connect to my dev device (joel@192.168.1.229) 
via ssh. When I'm done with a feature
I want to push those changes to the develop branch
Then I want my test device joel@192.168.1.135
to pull it down. 
If thats possible in github actions. (im still 
learning the concept).

$(cat .github/workflows/develop.yml)
